# Bundled ccusage helper

TokenRemain bundles the official arm64 and x86_64 ccusage native helpers as one
Universal macOS executable, so website-distributed builds can read local usage
without requiring Node.js, npm, or a first-launch package download.

The release build copies the executable to `TokenRemain.app/Contents/Helpers`,
signs it with the same identity as the application, and verifies its version and
signature before packaging.

Before a release build, `script/verify_ccusage_freshness.sh --update` checks the
official npm `latest` metadata. If a newer stable package exists, the script
verifies both registry SHA-1 and SHA-512 integrity values, package identities,
platforms, architectures and versions before producing the Universal helper.
The release build then signs the helper together with TokenRemain.

Installed copies never check or advertise ccusage package versions. Usage
collection remains offline; when the helper has no price for a token-bearing
model, the UI reports that the price is unavailable instead of displaying a
misleading `$0.00`.
